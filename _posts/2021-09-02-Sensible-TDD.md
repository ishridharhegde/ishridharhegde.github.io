It's common in our field that a practice, tool or process is often taken to extremes without understanding its intended purpose or limitations. 

I believe TDD has been a victim of that. I was recently trying to use TDD in one of my projects, and I faced some challenges in implementing it in practice. Upon doing some research, I found some of the articles and videos below, which gave me a better understanding of the practice and how it's been abused over the last two decades since it became popular.
