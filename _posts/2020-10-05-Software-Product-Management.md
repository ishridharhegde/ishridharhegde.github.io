Good software is the right product, done right, and managed right. I have found some of the material below helpful.

## Mooc's

1. [Software Product Management Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/product-management?): An excellent introductory course on Software Product Management to create Better Software using Agile Practices. Simple Examples with good extended reading material.

2. [Software Development Process](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud805): A free udacity course that gives an excellent theoretical introduction to Processes behind modern software development and gives an end-to-end view of things.
