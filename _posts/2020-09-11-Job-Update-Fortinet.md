I am highly elated to announce that I have joined [Checkpoint Systems, Bangalore](http://checkpointsystems.com/) as a Software Engineer (currently an intern but working full time on a project and to be given FTE later) for the Customer Success team. This is my first professional experience building software, and I am excited to jump into the world of practice.

Today was my first day and I had a call with my lead, [Pramod Kadam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pramod-kadam-1016a715/) who is a Solution Architect. 

I'm working remotely because of Covid and hope everything is going to be normal soon. Although commute and the city life is a bit hectic, I really want to work from office where I can interact with people and learn from them directly. Speaking to people on call without even seeing their face seems like I'm talking to the ether!
