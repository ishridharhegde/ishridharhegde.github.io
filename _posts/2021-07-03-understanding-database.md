## Quickly spin up databases
1. The rise of Docker has made Installation and testing Databases very easy. You can use [this](https://wkrzywiec.medium.com/database-in-a-docker-container-how-to-start-and-whats-it-about-5e3ceea77e50) article as a reference. Please check the docker hub page of the database software for the latest comments.

## The underlying stuff

## Book
I haven't read many Books on Databases, But one of the books I have read and found very useful is the [Database System Concepts](https://www.db-book.com/db7/) by Sudarshan et.al. I read the 6th edition years ago. This helps in deep diving into the databases and the foundational principles behind them.
